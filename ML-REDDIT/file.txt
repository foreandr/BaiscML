Told my girl about the study that showed that adult rats let adolescents rats win during play 30% of the time, because if the younger rats don't get a win every once in a while they lose interest and don't develop right. I told her that's usually the ratio I use when I play games with my nieces and nephew.   


She didn't make the connection that she also wins about 30% of the games we play lol,

As we all settle down for some shite, dry, oversized chicken that no one would normally eat; remember that Nancy Pelosi is the best trader of all time. Better, smarter and more opportunistic than any quant or hedge fund manager with decades of experience.

Retards, we like to witness obscure things in the market. How hasn't she been caught for insider trading? Is the Jeni eating ice cream Harpy really that brilliant? I think not and I'd rather shove that onion sage stuffing up my asshole than believe that shit.,

Oddly enough in hindsight I'm thankful for 2020 even though it was a hell of a year. Got out of retail and into an office in january after a couple months of admin work got sent home & was collecting the same paycheck sitting on my ass playing video games also for us bulls after the big 🌈 putting money in the market was literally free money my roth definitely got a turbo charge thanks to the boomers who panic sold. Laid off in the fall by some bitch in HR I never met, was depressed but almost immediately lined up a higher paying job with better culture and actually upward career trajectory. Stonks amirite?

The fact that people looked at Wish. A company that sells literal garbage, and thought it was a good investment blows my mind. There’s retarded and then there’s this.,

Wait...that actually works!!?,
wait u guys dont have porn on ur 2nd monitor?,
If you turn off both, there will be no losses!,
This is so retarded it actually may works,
Bankers ***HATE*** him!,
Can I do this through my phone app?,
But then how do you double your gains?,
i recognize the office as ARK headquarters but cant tell which ARK analyst that is sitting there.,
My secret alpha has been leaked to the masses. Dammit, third monitor it is.,
Here at ARK office we just use a green crayon on our second monitor🖍,
He cuts the loss in half assuming his chart is on log scale.,
I stopped using monitors... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
It is absolutely wonderful to see RH go down the shitter.  Karma is a bitch.,
Talk about disconnecting from reality...

But, does it work?,
Monitor? Lol. RH traders prefer charts without ticks and just push buttons on their phone.,
What if you disconnect both monitor? Do you stop losing money? In that case it’s better to cut the power too so you gain money no? Isn’t that how it works?,
I never buy red ambient light for my room. My second monitor is enough,
Delete app saves a lot,
Clearly one of us!,
Meanwhile taxes cut my profits in half too :/,
Damn. That is why I need two monitors.,
You guys use monitors to trade?,
Idiot. Should have flipped the monitor upside down to make infinite gains.,
Monitor sales spiked on black Friday and retailers are out of stock,

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT,
that's the invention of the century,
life changing solution,
You can also do this on mobile by only closing one eye when trading on the app.,
A post-it note might help too. Just block that part of the screen.,
 He do know for whenever reason he did 
that brought himself on a brain freeze,
Fact!!!,
What is this, The Wall Street Onion?,
Makes sense. Too much noise. I traded on my brother's computer while out of town and his screen had enough real estate for 4 charts. I had a losing streak my entire visit.,
Waiting to see if some 171221 20P print... Cost basis was .45....,
Literally ANY other stock I’d be all in due to this post. Robbinghoods………………. 😒,
Im gonna throw that 1 monitor i have and run trade in my mind. 


0 monitors = loss reduced by (1/4),
Jon WOOD,
🤣,
😱🤣,
Holding GME feels like legitimate activism at this point,
1. Flip monitor upside down. 
2. Invert colors (open Magnifier app, press Ctrl + Alt + I). 
3. 🤑🤑🤑,
I like the graph on the first monitor. May be he should place his bets on upside monitors...that will surely help I think.,
Using my phone only gives the best return,  not joking,
Thats why all my monitors are upside down,
Neat life hack,
Imagine his regrets knowing that he could have bought more monitors to cut even more losses.,
What was a ticket for 11/27 😭🥳,
[removed],
Mods why doesn’t this have DD flair?,
Ah, yes, RobinHood, stealing from the poor to give money to the rich. Seriously...why are you guys still using them after the whole GME cock block?,
How do I do this on my phone?,
*Robbinghood,
The whole appeal of RobinHood is the mobile interface isn't it? This way I can still use my gaming computer (from 2011) for gaming (games from 2013) and watch the Nintendo stock price go up and down. 

(I really hope Legends Arcius generates some hype this December lol),
Given all that greasy business practice, why is anyone still using Robinhood? I've taken out 400k of investment and transferred into Fidelity and Vanguard (for Free). Best decision ever. And I get to speak to customer rep and they are always helpful.,
You’re gonna just repost my meme on here for clout? Lol,
Uninstall the app and reinstall. Poof! No losses existed,
I have to look in to this, I’m on 3 monitors and a tv,
Sound like me when I was trading some internet coins a few years back.,
Fun fact: it works!,
Probably the worst app to use for investing. Same thing with cash app. The analytical information they give you is not good.,
This is what I come to WSB for.,
Wait.. you guys have a monitor and a cell phone!!!,
Quantum mechanics 😩,
Fuck I maxed the Robinhood credit card buying the single ultra wide screen monitor,
Hacks irl,
Would award if I had money instead of stonks,
If you rotate your screen 90°, you'll have more room for growth.,
We need to beat them very hard,
He should sell this strategy to hedgefunds,
Woah. It’s big brain time,
pro gamer move,
didn't they do the "sell the info, but say it was a ?hack? thing?",
Keep the monitor, and disconnect the WIFI.,
Delete the app and cut losses by another 1/3!,
This is fake guys when I turned my second monitor back on the losses were still there,
Where is the lol 😂 emoji,
Exact chart of theta depreciation,
Is this like a TheOnion article?,
You son of a bitch, I’m scared,
If you only make wrong moves, more information just means more wrong moves,
Schrodinger's loss,
So retarded... I've done it.,
Cut your only other monitor off and you don’t lose anything wow,
Turn the left monitor 90° clockwise and watch it go to the moon!,
Even better.  Just turn the monitor upside down and you automatically make more money.,
You all are cracking me up!!! Funniest responses! Love it!,
Sorry I only trade from my phone.,
I love my Robinhood; it depresses me hourly,
hoodinrobin,
The charts on RH are like a video game. No wonder we only see loss porn when a rh account holder posts!,
Damn yall got working monitors?,
That's a pro gamer move,
My Robinhood account is the only one that is green, btw.,
Lol. You beautiful bastards.,
Your lucky. Robinhood came and repossessed my second monitor... Im assuming to give to the poor.,
Problem solved. Easy.,
That graph looks like Monday sour hour ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640),
Does that mean that turning all monitors off will break even?,
This has 40k+ upvotes and makes me hate this sub.

And i'm talking after 5+ years of losing legit money didnt bother me.,
Does that mean I can destroy the circuit breaker in my house and wipe away my debt?,
Robinhood trader severs testicles after realizing they don't have the balls to switch to a real broker,
This is how I quit drugs. I ran up a big bill with all my dealers and then moved and changed my phone number. Problem solved.,
Just tell them you've temporarily suspended transactions. Ask if it sounds familiar.,
Best case? Write off and you get a tax form.

Worst case? They obtain a money judgement against you and garnish wages.

For the amount you owe? Probably charge off to third party collections.,
Well, either it goes into collections and you have to deal with debt collectors, or debt collectors know to stay far away from a bunch of ramen eating smooth brains and leave it for Robinhood to collect. Either way, probably not good for your credit.,
Delete the app and go about your life. Definitely stop trading 😂,
Time to load on $HOOD puts,
Write a one star review on yelp,
Maybe it'll just go away 😄,
You’re the real Robinhood, stealing from the rich and still being poor 😂,
Puts on this guys credit score,
This is great! Your balance is so good, they tell you it's OUTSTANDING!

Well done!,
Just tell them you have restricted the option to deposit money on their platform citing issues with their volatile stock and regulatory requirements.,
Vlad will call his Russian collectors and they will take care of it.

&#x200B;

Make sure you paid your health insurance premiums,
Just tell them you turned off the deposit button.,
Change your address on the account. If they can’t find you they can’t take your kneecaps,
Probably destroy your credit haha,
I owe them about $5000. Dumb fucks shouldn’t have lent me money I’m very irresponsible.,
Short robinhood until they go under so you don't have a company to pay lololol,
Letting people play with options turned Robinhood in an online casino / loanshark xD,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
It’s easy, just delete the app and the debt will be gone. No problems.,
Who cares, just give them the big bidness treatment, hold out long enough until they go under. Robinhood can’t collect when there is no Robinhood.,
Welp, you had two chances to learn from your mistake and pull out on the green but you belong here.,
1.  Response 1:  You disabled the ‘deposit button’.
2.  Response 2:  RH, go fuck yourself.
3.  Response 3:  Blow me.
4.  Response 4:  Ignore.,
Prob ding your credit report,
Good thing they don't have your social security number or anything.,
Stop trading; it's not for you. Once you come out of the other side of bankruptcy, just invest in boring ass funds and don't think about it. I generally think financial advisors are a waste of money, but I'd recommend one in your case because you clearly cannot be trusted with your own money. 

The government will use situations like yours as justification for taking options trading away from retail investors just like they did with day trading when the dotcom bubble popped.

Edit: also, get treatment for gambling addiction.,
They gonna bend u over and brutally assault that ass in due time if those dues aren’t paid brother, good luck,
Next time, do your investing through an offshore LLC and max out that margin!,
One day you will want to take out a loan, you won't be able to easily. 

I was a Mortgage broker for 8 years. Declines are real. 

Pay your debts.,
They email me everyday but other then that nothing wonder if they'll ever send it to collections 🤣?,
Eventually they'll sue you for it

That'll take some time though,
They will eventually write it off and you’ll just pay taxes on what you owe. My “friend” did this so I know ….,
Just delete the app all your problems go away that’s what my buddy said,
Let them send it to the collection agency and then negotiate down and pay it off.,
Tell them you have paused transactions. If that doesnt work, delete and disable notifications,
Tell them your deposit button was disabled by market makers unexpectedly increasing their liquidity demands. You regret any inconvenience this may cause them, but that you look to better serving them in the future.,
You probably used margin, in other words you lost their money trading. I don’t know the repercussions of not paying your debt to them. You probably eventually should though because it’s never good to owe someone…or you can just delete the app.,
Pay back a minimum amount every month. Just to delay the inevitable.  35.00?,
Well you’re a retard for spending more money than what you can afford. Pay back what you owe idiot,
Was this related to margin? Have they been adding interest to the amount you owe?,
Update us when you find out,
As long as you don’t care about your credit and being able to do adult things in the near future (mortgage, cars, applying for anything that runs a credit check) then you can take the advice of some of the potatoes in the comments and ignore it. 

If you plan to do adult things, probably work with your lawyer to work with RH about options. 

I was never really a fan of people bombing their finances and then just filing for bankruptcy - such a shitty move. 

My partners entire immediate family, save for his youngest sibling, has pulled this move at some point (Dad, Mom, Him, and one of his younger brothers). His just now dropped off his credit reports this last year, think this was back in 2013? he filed. I’ve got him to change his spending habits a bit but the rest of them live paycheck to paycheck in squalor. 

While it’s not impossible to recover from it - the difficulty setting definitely bumps up to Nightmare mode, especially if there is no support system and you keep repeating the same piss poor choices.,
How did you fail? That literally couldn’t have gone tits up 😂 only one man gets a pass on Robinhood and we all know him as Ironmani,
Messages were from August though,
Collections,
They’ll just keep sending you this message forever,
It’s only 4K just pay it so you don’t get fucked on the credit report.,
YOLO into WISH,
They’ll file a small claims suit, Settle it with arbitration and if you don’t show up to court, they will get a default judgment. 
Once they have a judgment, they can do 1 of 3 things to collect. They can garnish your paycheck, they can file a bank levy which drains your bank account entirely, and they can put a lien on your home if you own your home.
If you don’t own a home and have not bought, the mortgage company will look to pay off any outstanding judgements by financing it into your home.,
your a fucking dumbass,
Just out of curiosity how did you manage to go into the negative?,
How can you go negative???,
Delete account and create new one 😅,
Pay your debt. Don’t be a loser.,
Too everyone saying pay what you owe, you can't pay money you don't have... All in all I'm actually 50K in debt and only make 40K a year 🙄 so yeah I'd love to pay them I just can't anytime soon lmao,
Pay what you owe……man up 😐,
For a debt like this 4k, they probably won't do much. Tbh, most legal avenues for collecting this debt are more expensive than sending it to collections.

Your ARE on the cusp though. So it's possible that you may get sued in small claims with your local magistrate.

However it's possible, even likely, they don't bother and just send it to collections and in 7 years it goes away.,
Nah, they down 4K. You up.,
So you've been Robbing the Robinghood? 🙂,
Tell them you are doing God’s work! Robbing the rich to owe the rich - nah not working!,
Step 1: let the battery deplete on your phone
Step 2: have you tried uninstalling the app
Step 3: (Profit),
They’ll take you in the back room and break your legs,
I have an even better question....  How the hell does one owe Robinhood anything, much less managing to owe them $4k?  I'm seriously wondering how that's even possible to do.,
Cousin Vinny's gonna have a word with you.,
They'll be gone when GME moons,
And I thought I was retarded,
They actually do nothing,
Just do what they did act like it never happened if they take you to court just lie under oath,
Fuck yer credit up?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
Yep ! TELL THEM U CAN'T FIND THE TRANSFER BUTTON IN YOUR ACCOUNT ! 🤣💥,
OP PLEASE READ THIS

Ur gay,
They’ll enter it into collections and get a default judgment against you, garnish your wages, and trash your credit for 7 years.,
Something tells me your email will have more details 🤔,
Have a moustache? If not, now’s a great time to grow one. Already got one? Now’s a great time to shave it. Also might wanna consider investing in hats and sunglasses,
🐻ish,
Just delete the app bro you’ll be fine,
Robbing the hood.,
Tell them you removed the deposit button.,
They are going to send Little John to break your legs.,
Just delete the app, problem solved,
How does one owe an investment platform?,
They’ll probably debit bad debt expense and credit accounts receivable.,
Just delete the app bro, find a new place to lose money. It’s unrealized losses,
Deleting the app won’t make your debt go away. Pay your debt.,
You seem really really dumb,
Depends where you are, usually they send Gino and his friends to pay a visit if in Northeast, not sure about other areas...,
Just print more money. 🤷🏻‍♀️

That's what our Uncle Sam does.,
Quit being a schmuck and pay your debt.,
Change your username. And just ignore Robinhood.,
Part of history in your credit score. U screw for life,
Just pay the $4k you retard. Spend a Saturday night on the corner and you’ll make that back,

Wasn’t this a black mirror episode?,
Society may be crumbling, but at least I am the 1000th upvote,
so they will just crowd around every american visitor to China so they can say " i collected one!!",
Wow just like in America with Credit scores and the way we treat the poor and homeless. It's nice to see multiple countries running toward their own dystopian nightmare before we go extinct as a species.,
How to change Identity?? Asking for self,

Money is created through debt... Hmm...,
I have nearly three million dollars in debt. All of it at a low fixed rate.,
Just one step closer to squid game this gives the train station man his targets to play ddakji with, slap, then give his card to...,
A solution to this inflation issue is straightforward and easy.

The only thing the government needs to do is to collect the taxes that are already on the books. No new taxes, just collect those that are on the books already.

Less money needs to be printed, the budget doesn’t have to be a problem.

Also, we could stop subsidising the oil industry, giving yet-more-tax-cuts to the wealthy and cut $250 billion out of the DoD budget and lo and behold things might be turning around.,
Great way to get people to social distance.,
\*USA has exited the chat\*,
\*Apple bans app from Apple store\*,

For some, society is just a computer game. Wish we had an old save file.,
I've always wondered how much in debt people here really are. I'd hope most are at least somewhat green, right? Or are people *really* gambling away their life savings and ending up in debt? (Apart from the idiots yoloing their student loans and going 4k in debt or some shit),

The 6.84 commission and fees is the final slap in the face🤣👊,
I was sad about losing 5k. Respect to you,
Then today is the day it turns around. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270),
That's just the short term gain. If you look a little to the right, you'll see you broke even on the long term.,
Avoid taxes with this one simple trick the IRS doesn't want you to know about,
You invested in a Chinese counterfeit flea market.,
It's not a loss until you sell!  Oh... it's a loss now.,
You're getting Reddit karma though. So that should cheer you up.,
$6.84 Commission and fees.  Damn.  They didn't even comp your room or give you a free pass to the 24-hour buffet.,
going to $50 next week thanks to your contribution,
Damn!,
He sold? Pump eeeeeetttttt,
Damn I’m so hard right now.,
Holy fuck, this hurts to look at.,
I'm down like 400$ if it makes you feel any better,
How TF people get this much money to lose in one go? :(,
When you buy a house from wish but get a cardboard box in the mail,
If you have that much money to throw around, you could have been making $10k+ a week selling CCs on actually good stocks.,
I can only imagine this feels like your finger sticking through the toilet paper in a public bathroom,
you can recover from a $5k loss. or a $50k loss even, with proper investing and enough time.

but $500k loss??? dunno man. that is life changing level of damage. 

I know I wouldnt be able to forgive myself if i did a stupid yolo with $500k and lost it all. note to others: dont yolo with six figures. yolo with $5k here and there. 

but good luck, man. please speak to a therapist. you will need some mental support and therapy after surviving this nuke bomb,
Every retard on WSB knows that the best way to not pay taxes is to lose money....no wait.,
And it goes up 20% once you did,
I WISH I didn't buy that stock 😕,
He'll be claiming that 3k tax break till he D I E,
didn't need to happen,
I am genuinely curious why you dropped this amount of cash on such a terrible company.,
Hope you didn’t already sell 😂,
Dam that was my lambo,
Damn easily lost a house or 2 with that one. Ouch!!!,
Dude if you had a better broker with less fees, could have saved some money.,
Dayyum.....Has anyone asked you if you are okay?,
Calls on wish!,
These wishtards are my favorite, everyone knew this company was dogshit but they all had a dream, what if it isn't? They may lose money and no one legit uses their site but they have billions in cash. If Wish had just closed down the shitty website and put all the cash into SPY these dudes would all be showing gain porn today.,
Why would you put half a million into terrible stock like this. You could have just bought some solid company that is massively down, look at Visa or PYPL, they have been massacred recently but they are actual solid companies, not a disaster like Wish.,
This is worthy of my free award.,
I'm starting to think that for ppl on wb money grow on trees.,
Paper hands over here,
Think of all the taxes you don’t have to pay.,
You deserve to lose it after putting 0.5m instead of 520k,
#Paper handed biatch!,
Ouch.  Respect for cutting the loss of a dead play.  Hope the next one goes better.

  (Maybe start your own online dildo shop instead of gambling on someone else's?),
That much blown on a mere WISH? 3x sector ETF play is the way to go once you have $1m.,
F,
The loss isn't realized until your wife realizes you lost a half a million and you don't even have shitty WISH lingerie to gift her.,
And I thought my -2K call was bad,
Dude you paid a $6 commission.  You probably qualify for free trades.  Switch brokers.,
why didn't you sell covered calls on this baby on the way down? you could have easily made back at least 100k+,
I think you zigged when you should of zagged.,
Tax loss harvesting for a lifetime,
You can right off 3k in your tax return,
Friday wish squeezes to 20 bucks!,
Well that didn't age well...  
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qbxd7v/comment/hhdkn1h/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3,
He sold. Pamp it,
Fuck this stock. I’m in the same boat.,
All time highs tomorrow confirmed.,
Where do retards like this get a half a million dollars,
Ahhhh wish… the loss porn I can count on with consistency

Nice job OP👍🏾,
And tomorrow is the day WISH goes +400%,
It will probably hit $20 next week,
Put it all in AMZN yolo,
I *wish* you the best of luck with your future investing to recover from this,
REALLY freaking glad I wussed out on that one.  I was about 75-25 on a YOLO when it was getting pimped on this board. 
Decided against it because of bad press about shipping from China having problems.,
Just hold,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
This made my -40% loss of total account a lot better,
Can you help me get to your level?,
It looks like your wishes were not granted : ( Sorry dude,
RIP,
Time to buy wish shares,
Buy the dip!!!!!! 🥴,
Who would have thought buying stock in an expensive version of Aliexpress that sells nothing but garbage and poor copies of things was a bad idea?,
Why sell,
I lost 3K and I was devastated, I was thinking “what am I?” After seeing this;),
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266),
How did your dumbass have so much money on the first place,
I $WISH you the best, bro,
On the plus side, that's 174 years of loss carry-forwards on your taxes!,
Looks like someone got his WISH,
Reasonable commission of $6.84.  So not a total loss,
congrats can write off the losses for 173 years in current tax law 😪,
This is what I needed to see,  Just went all in. Thanks for the signal,
I don’t feel so bad about being down $1,500 anymore.,
If I had so much money I would have put it in quality stocks and already made 100K more :S,
If you can lose 500k, my girl can get over me losing 20k,
At least you’ll have that $3,000 loss write off for the next 166 years.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),
I guess WISHes don't come true.,
Man you make me sick, what a dumb YOLO, god bless you sir,
You are a moron,
Atleast you won’t have any taxes this year lmao,
Today is the day you wish never knew $WISH,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
Let this be a lesson to you degenerates. Not everyone on here makes big money. In fact, the vast majority lose money. So stay in school and get a real job for solid income.,
Get fucked greedy boomer,
The make a wish foundation does make money, what did you expect,
My condolences bro,
Basic 101 question… since you lost 500k did someone earn 500k in this transaction? Or did the “market” earn the 500k?,
This is actually sad..,
No tendies but a lot of handies,
u/cliquekilla omg,
Pamp eet,
If you were on RH, the loss would have been less. You could have saved $6.84 in commission & fees 😂,
I suggest this [thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/r0qm9g/how_we_should_start_to_see_the_autism_spectrum),
How much do you have left? We need to consolidate it and come up with a trading strategy for December.,
F,
On the plus side your commission was less than seven dollars!,
Thank you for participating in price discovery!,
TAKE IT BOY!,
Its always the retards with their millions,
I'm sure that money be well spent on some nice odd gadgets.,
Any reason why you are selling today? Curious if you know something we don't ..,
It’s gonna go up now,
F,
 staaaahp you're making me horny! 😩,
You will not be forgotten. There will be a seat with your name on it with the other WSB gods in heaven.,
Why the hell would you buy stocks in a company like Wish,
What type of dent does this put on your overall wealth?,
I feel for u bro... I wouldnt take the entire loss in one year tho...

Offset any gains, assuming you have some and then carry the rest of the WISH loss to next year and keep doing that each year until u negate ur gains

Selling it all at once will just offset this years gains and will only allow u to write off 5k each year after that... its more of a win for the IRS than it is for u,
I lost $400 yesterday and its eating me alive. Thanks for the pick me up.,
Honestly, I don't understand Wish.

If you wanna buy things in Wish, why don't you buy in Ali Express,
I almost had a heart attack when I lost 1.5k.,
Wow, jizzed in my pants,
WHat is your next move?,
I'm a little confuse - this says SHORT TERM GAIN.  OP, are you sure you've actually lost $500k and not MADE $500k?  plz respond,
Congrats! Nothing like a locked-in tax deduction to prepare you for a Thanksgiving feast!,
F,
F,
Bummer man you'll bounce back,
See it's that $6.84 commission that's gettin ya right there.,
Dude Jan 2023 $15c were $6 like three months ago… you could’ve made like $500k just selling premium 🥲,
I trust the OP, but are all these “loss” posts legit ‘Cause these number are boggling my mind,
You had half a mil to lose.  I don’t feel bad for you.,
makes my 500 dollar loss not so bad, still pissed though,
You do understand that under IRS rules this will give you a $3,000 annual tax deduction for each of the next 170 years?,
It’s .05% green. Time to sell,
Buy Chinese, get Chinese,
at this point jst donate to a charity man,
Don’t come close to wish!  It’s a dead wish!,
Bro ouch . Idk what hurts more the comer of the bed banging on a pinky or you loss

Corner*,
This is a buy indication if I’ve ever seen one,
Big oof!,
Dass tut mir so leid Schwester. Viel Glück beim nächsten Mal,
I would shit my pants if i wasnt on a toilet,
Uncle Sam hates him.,
Here’s an award,
With 750k he could have BOUGHT a Wendy's franchise. 

Follow the logic, sell Wendy's to WSB traders, like tools to gold digger fools... 

It's so cunning...,
You idiot.,
HAHAHA,
At least your short-term gain ended in 69,
gg,
You followed a furu into battle and lost but the war can still be won. Make it back on the next trade.,
I wish I may, I wish I might, I wish I didn't lose half a mil on a Chinese knock off site.,
The president and I are proud of you!,
How can you make a loss from shares?,
I’m so confused why so many bought this company. Like do you even know what they do or their reputation? Their products are the worst shit ever. One person got a dead oyster with no preservatives as a “$5 pedal kit”. But I appreciate the nut so thank op.,
this dude don’t fuck.,
The dangers of buying into hype stocks "it's the next AMZN", fundamentals always corrects the price over time.,
There will always be a better play. Don’t worry,
Relax, it's just $500K, not 0.5 Million,
Look on the bright side  - "Long Term Gain $0.00"

So it's a beginner's first time slipup. You may have lost half a fragging million, but the experience gained is totally huge. Dude - from now on you can **put it on your CV**. Up front.,
Gonna be one hell of a tax write off,
F,
Now it can finally go up,
I can definitely nut to this after bashing on WISH and CLOV for months, calling them pump and dumps.,
i mean. is this tax evasion?,
Sad you didn t buy more quality. I hope your job brings you a fortune,
Can anyone explain why this is not being supported by WSB and they so keep saying that this forum has no power to boost a stock or not because we truly have come to understand that retailers have more into them then the expected. When this gets to 20 will all have or rewards and yes WISH still can go to the moon if wanted.,
CEO living good while shareholders lose…. I stayed away from wish after seeing how they were spending money on a Wish la mansion/office.   It was ridiculous and a total waste of investor money. Literally, a party mansion. 

Then CEO drops 15 mill cash for his own home and I’m like no shame with these people.  

https://www.dirt.com/moguls/tech/peter-szylczewski-house-bel-air-1203291695/,
thanks for doing that, now i can sell mine for a smaller loss too afterwards.,
You did not lose anything, you just gained -$521,916.69,
You have lost twice as much as my entire NW 👌 
Thanks for making me feel better.. 

Wish sells garbage to dimwits, what were your thoughts before you dumped 730k into that dumpster fire?,
I WISH you would've just gave me the money instead.,
I’m still holding so hoping you turn it around for me.,
true WSB moment that I come to find my WISH calls are tankning.,
Damn,
Congratulations mate. Who wants Christmas anyway?,
This does satisfy.,
Take care of yourself.,
Unfortunate,
lol this company was trash from the beginning, why would you invest in something with absolut no fundamentals,
Geez big fucking f my dude,
I'm really confused with that type of screenshot. Who ever works with flat amounts instead of percentages?,
"0.5M" lmao this dude desperately wants to be a millionaire.,
Should spread it out over years to never pay tax again lol,
This really makes me feel better about myself. I wish you well.,
Saving this and coming back in a few months,
Hey at least you retain some honor instead of being the dudes who try pumping it to drop their bags,
My stomach hurts from just looking at this,
Honestly you deserve it,
You dumb fuck,
Buy high. Sell low. Nice,
Wow. Now I don’t feel so bad.,
So you took one for the team and  now it will shoot up next week, thanks,
God speed you degenerate,
It’s just 500k, don’t worry - wait till the next Covid mutation to make it back. 👀,
Could've been a lambo,
Half a milly on WISH jesus I thought I was retarted,
It's pretty hilarious to me just how badly this Zack Morris scammed people with $WISH. He's out there posting green P/L, 4m+ yet tells his followers "he's 100% still in"

How SEC hasn't come after that cuck yet...,
It’s going to tank again. I wouldn’t sweat it. I literally have money on it.,
Try deleting your account instead.,
yo degenerate might break even by going in on Tesla in maybe 10 years lol,
I needed this,
Take that, IRS!,
Here is one well-deserved Internet point,
I did the same as well with 50k shares, needed the tax loss anyways. Will revisit in Q1 after Q4 earnings. The thesis is intact but theres no rush in jumping in right away.,
It's the buying signal!,
F,
Fuck, big F,
Was the France article the reason for jumping ship today? If you were paper handing this thing idk why you wouldn’t jump at 5/6 it was so obvious,
you could have bought 521,916 useless things on wish.,
I wish you the best of luck in future endeavors,
What was your thesis for buying WISH in the first place ?,
I've said it before and I'll say it again. Wish is the most garbage joke of a company out there. If you're willing to dump 700k into that then have I got the investment of a lifetime for you! see here, im an African Prince and im stuck in customs, all I need from you is,
~logs in to buy WISH,
Makes me feel better about losing 150k of my 300k portfolio over the past sixth months. You’ll get em next time king.,
If you do it's gonna turn green.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
That should make for interesting thanksgiving day conversation.,
woooow,
Do you want me to spit first before they insert or just man up and take it raw dog?,
I mean wish can't go lower right.......right? Lol like it really can't now,
Ouch,
You’re saving $200k because that pos company is going to $0,
the good news is that you'll never pay capital gains tax again. the bad news is that you'll never pay capital gains tax again.,
Now that you’ve sold, I think I’ll buy. I have a feeling it will be coming back up now,
Thank you this made my 8k loss soul feel better,
Time to buy I guess,

Pizza Time!,
I don't think you know what the word transitory means.  The fed uses a little different dictionary then us common folk,
Well

The thing is the price goes in rythme with salary!

But But But

Where is the rising part of my paycheck???,
To be fair, the ice age was also transitory.,
If you want to have fun Google “margin expansion” and “earnings transcript” restrict to last month. 

Almost every single company is jacking up prices right now because they can. 

Folks have lots of money to spend and this cat ain’t going back in the bag. 

It’s not supply constraints and fuel (that’s a little bit of the price increase, but if it was everything…we wouldn’t be seeing “margin expansion”, if anything we’d see margins shrinking), it’s just corporate greed and shoppers who are suckers enough to keep buying overpriced shit.

Where all the consumer cash is coming from, I have no idea. But folks are spending like crazy.,
Anyone ever thought of the idea of instead of adding .25 cents to the loaf of bread, just take away three slices? Then after an adjustment period, return the 3 slices and charge only .10 cents more.,
Inflation is not transitory... "yet"...

\- JPOW 2029,
Why even bother to say anything at all? They can raise or lower or do anything they want, it’s not a democracy it’s a dictatorship, he doesn’t have to convince anyone of his decisions.,
Dollar store now $1.25 store. What are the chances they go back to a buck?,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) Anyone with a 🧠 knew this in the spring 🤷‍♂️,
When the Truth is obvious but politicians pretends we are stupid or something. Yeah ok.,
Actual facts on WSB? What is happening right now?,
I’ve got the [powell !](https://youtu.be/O1hCLBTD5RM),
This too shall come to pass.,
Fear Bait in this one is strong...,
Without inflation stocks wouldn't go up. Stonks are good, henceforth inflation is good.,
Morons thinking this pent up demand inflation is permanent probably thoughts oil would be negative dollars forever too.,
Next months inflation numbers could be over 7%,
The authorities changed the definition of "vaccine".  The authorities changed the definition of "fully vaccinated".  The authorities changed the definition of "emergency".  The authorities changed the definition of "crime". 

You don't think they changed the definition of "transitory" and just failed to publish it?  1984,
Great one thanks,
FUCCCCKKKK,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641),
Loololllplolollloll,
Collect your fucking taxes, you fucking morons!,
If somebody told you I was your average ordinary Chairman of the Fed- somebody lied.,
Everyone is happily willing to pay inflated prices for the same goods. They even have a motivation to buy more as they believe it will be even more expensive in the future.

Inflation is bullish on stocks,
Bet Powell makes out upside down like a boss,
Im a little worried. I started posting comparisons of the stock market to the M2 supply showing that weve actualy been in a sideways market for 10+ years compared to purchasing power. .... now my trading view wont register any derivative graphs with money supply... pretty sure im on a watchlist lol,
Buy silver and gold as a hedge against inflation.,
Did they actually finally admit that?,
Yeah it is tho? Straight to communism or faschism.,
But we do appreciate everything you do. Here’s a fun sign we’re gonna put outside your workplace for everybody to vandalize. Later ho’s,
Is the printer broke?,

I got a ban bet on BB...100% see it running.

Ban bet is $15 by December 15.  But, a few apes and this will hit blue skies and moon.,

Don BB! This is the DD right here, Blackberry is Backberry. Let’s beast.,
I don’t feel pain Bag holding this, unlike $wish,
Let’s go bb to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀,
I really hope so. I got some $12 calls expiring in Jan and it's been under water for a long long time...,
Is the time ripe for blackberry? 🚀🚀🚀,
You had me at 🚀🚀🚀,
I'm all in 🚀🌕,
LETS GOOOOOO🚀🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,
I bought more calls today. My calls root for this.,
Black Berry is the tartest of all positions!,

My BB bags are heavy but still have them packed and ready for the ride,

Got some shares and 17$ C exp 2024. Fly baby fly i need that bb squirt juice all over my tendy wendy plate,
Lots of words for a dead stock. That last image gave me a huge laugh, ty,
>Buying BlackBerry now is similar to buying $AMD at $2.00 in 2014 when SU BAE stepped in as CEO

\> Lisa Su appointed CEO in 2014 -> $AMD **runs up almost every year** **for 7 years**

\> AMD revenues steadily climb after 2016 low

&#x200B;

\> John Chen appointed CEO in 2013 -> $BB **trades sideways** **for 8 years**

\> BB revenues fall almost every year since 2013

&#x200B;

[Seems legit](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/stock-comparison?s=revenue&axis=single&comp=AMD:BB).,
Bagholders lolol,
I’m just waiting for institutions to sell whilst saying “it’s all been priced in since like January, idiots!”.,
bbagholders,
You comparing BB, which has completely stagnant growth, to CRWD, which has parabolic growth? Man, you are special.,
So we should buy puts, got it,
[removed],
I sold BB at a loss. Not falling for this again. I’d still be at a loss if I held it right now.,
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀Buy Buy BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,
Oh yes daddy Chen,
BB spends so much time at $10 you'd think its a SPAC,
It's year 2025. BB is 12 bucks and you guys will be like "iTs MoOniNg"

Former BB shareholder/employee who bought at 8 and sold at the meme run up,
oh my god you people have been posting this "due diligence" for over a year now. same old shit,
No no no no no no not again!,

lol the amount of $WISH losses I’ve seen is crazy. What’s with the hype around them? My condolences as well.,
How do people just lose this much money,
But it’s green, that’s good, right?,
If there was a premium for bad ideas I'd want drilling rights to your head.,
Worst of all I actually got banned from buying things on wish after this incident:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/Wishstock/comments/q019dg/initialized\_110\_chargeback\_on\_an\_wish\_order\_and\_i/,
This is a loss that won't be a good long hold.,
Next time just give it to me, I’ll give you half the losses,
God damn a lot of retards in here got absolutely ass blasted by wish.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),
It's always wish in these screen shots,
Ayoooo bro this gotta suck,
S e l l c a l l s,
I want this go for $69 not $0.69🤦‍♂️,
Seriously, why do so many people YOLO on $WISH. The memes says everything you need to know about this stonk LOL,
So I buy hella things on wish. Little things nothing major during 2020 I bought a lot of fishing lures and some cool accessories for my car. Spent about 1k on wish in 2020. Fast forward to 2021 around august and for absolutely no reason every purchase I had ever made on wish was fully refunded. I wasn’t the only one this happened to. My gf and a couple of my friends that buy things from wish all got all their orders refunded for no reason. So I’m sure most if not all users were refunded for everything they’ve bought on wish  I’m not sure what caused that but I’m sure they lost millions if not billions due that fiasco.,
Of all the companies to choose from and you chose this dog.,
Congratulations!  

I think?,
Keep going and you’ll have a diversified portfolio,
When you yolo thinking it can't go any lower. I did this with uwmc when I thought $9 was low.,
Sleeping in the tool shed rights unlocked! 😂,
I don't get how selling counterfeits is not a red flag and you stayed invested in this company.,
Congratulations on your bereavement,
this stock makes SDC look like a rockstar in comparison,
Anotha one..,
Please run away if you wish.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263),
You still have five figures. You only lost one figure.,
Do you sell covered calls. You could make reduce your cost basis significantly while you wait for this to rebound, which it will.,
Lmao fuck. Hopefully you get to zero. Best of luck !,
Why the fuck aren’t people setting trailing stop losses? It’s not cool or funny to lose this much on shares alone.,
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257),
love how everything’s still green,
achievement unlocked!,
Coal for xmas....,
Nicely done..keep going,
I thought you were showing my @CLOV position, but then I saw you have only lost 54.81% and I realized it wasn’t mine.  

Nice try but you’ll have to lose more to catch me.,
at 3.97 doe, how low can it go, might have to yolo moms life savings on hopes this guy breaks a profit,
Oh no Daddy-O, you bought WISH!,
Why the fuck are you still holding? Just sell and you can get into stocks and options that can get you that loss back,
With this kind of money playing this kind of stock, you have WISH,
Can you just cash out $10k and zelle me the money before your account goes to zero? It’ll go to paying off some bills thank you.,
At least they are shares not fds,
It doesn’t look like you sold. So it’s not actually a loss.,
I still don’t get why don’t you guys just leave this stock alone,
I’m convinced all the wish positions are bots 
No way a regular person does this,
The final accomplishment.,
Get this man a shield!,
Amex knew you had money in stocks and options. They decided to sell all of their shares and short the fuck out of wish for the sole reason just to fuck you after their financial review,
There should be flairs that you can only get after proving something like this to a mod. 6Figures in red or green.,
I could of seen my kids more often with this money...,
Switch to puts?,
u/MagThanos,
I wish the same. 🤦‍♀️,
Don't $WISH this on anyone ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276),
Are you still bullish on this?,
good job op.atleast you didnt fomo in at > $20,
How many of you retards bought this shit stock? No one uses Wish, first red flag,
Was that your $wish?,
I *$WISH* you best of luck king,
This is an even bigger mess than $BABA.,
Guh,
Balances the gain by wsb ❤️,
Put that shit in AMZN the fuck,
Are you selling 210 CCs to lower cost basis? It’s something,
Zack Morris fucks your mom,
Everyday I Wish I bought puts😞😞 WHY DO YOU NEED ME TO LOGIN Before I check out ur site 🙁🙁,
I see the color green good job man,
*achievement unlocked* crayon eating retard! Somebody get this man a helmet!,
Congratulations my dude!!,
Excellent.,
This has to be the most retarded stock ever. Don't know why people keep buying it.,
Pretty sure someone somewhere jumped because of the wish pump,
all this wish loss porn…. should have bought amc,
Because you didn’t go 100% retard,
dude, did you ever order from wish?

I ordered a watch and it turned out to be a cheap toy.

i ordered wind chimes and they sent me some weird sex toy.

dude come on man. are you serious with spending 100 k on WISH stock???,
1/3 of the way there,
Seeing all this loss porn makes me want to buy WISH just for the memes,
I can't believe so many fell for this Chinese scam company....ridiculous,
I can only get to 5, any way to go to six-figures like this guy?,
Im only at a 160$ loss am I doing this right ?,
Good job retard! See ya in the food stamp line!  fr though, that sucks.. you should mail your phone to mexico and lock your doors,
I'm also bag holding too but holy fuck.

Wish has up potential but also plenty of potential to go to 0 too. Definitely not something you put 6 figures in.,
At least they aren't options...,
[removed],
Nice,
Greeeeen,
I mean tbh it has serious potential. Buying now and it being so cheap is nice. I feel like they’re 2 good choices away from booming. Someone described that they need a few facilities in various countries that hold their most popular items and have them available for fast shipping.,
Wow,
lol i remember when everyone was hyping up wish on here.  I took one look at their website, and was like yeah this company is fucking trash.  I can’t believe anyone would be bullish on them 😂,
Achievement unlocked,
Sell CC’s until you break even?,
Shit like this makes me so happy I never touched wish. Good luck op,
same here, mine didn't start with digit 1,
Why did you unjustly l initially buy into wish and why do you still hold it?,
Proud 🦆,
Six figure. Nobody counts pennies, you chump.,
Get the fuckk outta here with the Robbinhood  fake graph,
You just love giving money to the CCP don’t you,
Fuck,

Does it distinguish good debt vs bad? I mean i know a dude with no debt, but he also lives under a bridge and eats for free at this place, well kitchen really, that serves soup,
They'll probably cancel that when they realize everyone has debt they can't pay.,

Is this even a real article? The social credit score was proposed, but never implemented.,
Any system that allows enough centralised authority to do stuff similar to this eventually will as it's within its space of possibility. Social credit systems may not be socialism, I'll accept that as it's a form competition, but it's definitely enabled by the authority required to "seize the means of production."

Also, if you're a socialist on a stock trading subreddit then you need to rethink what you're doing with your life.,
I like how Americans, instead of making college affordable or changing the system to make it unnecessary, or simply don't attend... instead just give out large debt to lay for it, and make it ok that people don't pay it back.,
China is beyond fucked.,

If you have a mortgage, then pretty much everyone will be in debt. What's the point of this? Debt is a good thing for rich people. Do they want to recruit for squid games or something?,

God I wish I had bought SPY 469c 0DTE was so obvious but inversing myself has become a laborious challenge,
"Tax Write-Off",
I'm not selling at the bottom. I'm reweighting my portfolio to a more equitable position.,
SoFly,
You must own T like I do.  The daily, "Should I sell my $250,000 worth of T and buy something, anything else?" question.🤦,
Just hold. Hold god damn it. Hold. Hold 💎🙌,
DWAP,
That’s what I’m talking about!,
Just show us your WISH losses already,
God I hope this is the bottom,
Hey that at least means he knows where the bottom is. Respect.,
Holding forever has spared me the vagaries of the unstable market.,
Buy low, sell lower,
